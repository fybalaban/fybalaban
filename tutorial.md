2. Make sure to rename the fork to your username; if you don't perform this renaming, you won't be able to see the README.md on your profile.

1. Start by changing your name, then move on to your current work. High school, university, or higher education? Communities you contribute to... work experiences...
2. Specify your technical capabilities, preferably list them.
3. Talk about your interests and research domains, what gets you excited, what you want to improve, or what makes you want to change the world!
4. Write about your favourite achievements!
5. Curate a list of your current whereabouts and what you're doing. You can show off projects, learning materials you're consuming or even what series you binge-watch!
6. I prefer to keep it simple when it comes to communication. You can make a table or list or write a paragraph like me.
